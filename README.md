# Customer Personality Analysis with Python

This project analyzes customer demographics and behavior using Python and data visualization techniques.  
It aims to uncover insights from the *Customer Personality Analysis* dataset and answer key business questions related to income, spending, education, and customer segments.
 
## Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world marketing data from Kaggle, including handling of null values and data type conversions
- Removed outliers using the IQR method and visualized the data before and after cleaning
- Performed feature engineering and variable transformations (e.g., column renaming, normalization)
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, boxplots, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Addressed key business questions through visual insights and statistical summaries, such as:
  - The relationship between income, education, and expenses
  - Spending patterns across different demographic groups
  - Product category preferences by customer segments
  - Customer engagement and website visit frequency trends

## Business Questions Explored

1. Is there a correlation between income and expenses?
2. How do customer demographics (education, marital status, children, age) influence spending?
3. What distinguishes high-income customer segments?
4. Which product categories generate the most revenue across segments?
5. Do newer customers behave differently over time?
6. Does website visit frequency influence total purchases?
